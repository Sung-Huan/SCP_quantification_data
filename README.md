# SCP and BCP quantification data
This is MaxQuant protein and peptide quantification tables for SCP and BCP. The raw data can be found at https://scp.slavovlab.net/Leduc_et_al_2022

SCP_IMBR_PSM: SCP dataset where both IMBR and PSM-level normalization were applied.

SCP_IMBR: SCP dataset with IMBR applied but without PSM-level normalization.

SCP_PSM: SCP dataset where IMBR was not used, but PSM-level normalization was applied.

SCP_None: SCP dataset without the application of both IMBR and PSM-level normalization.

BCP_IMBR_PSM: BCP dataset where both IMBR and PSM-level normalization were applied.

BCP_PSM: BCP dataset where IMBR was not used, but PSM-level normalization was applied.

Annotation_table_SCP: this table can be imported into Perseus for annotating the SCP data. (Processing->isobaric labeling->Annotation from a file)

Annotation_table_BCP: this table can be imported into Perseus for annotating the BCP data. (Processing->isobaric labeling->Annotation from a file)
